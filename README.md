This is the reminiscence of a machine learning course project.

Description from the official Kaggle website:

http://inclass.kaggle.com/c/csci-5622-forest-cover-type-prediction

The goal in this competition is to predict the cover type of a small forested region from cartographic information. The features include things like elevation, aspect, slope, etc. There are 7 different classes of trees.

====

In this Kaggle competition, I used logistic regression, SVM, random forest (by calling sklearn package) and nerual network (from scratch and also pybrain).

In this competition, my Kaggle account was taian.

On Jan 27, 2015, logistic regression, SVM, and random forest are done.
